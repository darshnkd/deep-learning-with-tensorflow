## Introduction

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to deep learning using TensorFlow, covering essential topics like neural network regression and classification. You'll learn how to build and train models by defining a neural network architecture, compiling it with appropriate loss functions and optimizers, and training it on data. You'll also explore methods for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices. By visualizing learning curves and tweaking the model, you can iteratively enhance its accuracy and generalization.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project, as everything is done on **Google Colab**. Google Colab provides a free cloud-based environment where you can run all the code without needing to set up anything locally.

To get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**: You can either clone the repository to your Google Drive or directly open the notebooks in Google Colab.

2. **Open in Colab**: Click the Colab badge or open the `.ipynb` files directly in Google Colab.

3. **Run the Cells**: Follow along with the instructions in the notebooks, running the cells as you go.

Google Colab already has TensorFlow pre-installed, so you're ready to start experimenting with deep learning models right away!
